Submit proposals on Upwork (but not Toptal)
    - The problem with this is limited proposals or "connects"
    - Don't use filters -- you have to filter out more visually, but many people are likely to use incorrect settings and you filter away possible jobs

Write a blog and wait for people to contact you
    - This takes a long time and you need to be consistent + score posts that have high Google traffic

Write answers on Stack Overflow and wait for people to contact you
    - This can take a lot of time and you have to build up lots of answers and keep your profile active
    
Outreach on LinkedIn
    - Connect with owners and hiring managers of agencies so you can leverage their existing sales structure

Leverage your existing contacts
    - If you've worked with people in the past (agencies) or people would be willing to retweet a "looking for work" post, reach out to them

Search Twitter for work
    - Search for phrases like "looking for work" or "remote" or "react contractor" etc. on Twitter

Work on demo projects in the mean time
    - Not sure about this one -- but it might be a good idea to keep busy while looking for work, if you get sick of searching for jobs all day maybe brush up your portfolio to have something to show people publicly, especially when all of your best work is private, like mine.

Visit subreddits where people post jobs.
