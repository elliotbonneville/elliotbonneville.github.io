After a whirlwind week of travel up and down the west coast (a flight every single day, Monday through Friday), I've made it safely back to New England with a new appreciation for clean air and the crisp cold climate of late fall. I did miss the first snow of the season by a day, but that's fine -- there's always next year.

I was out in California this past week to kick off a contract with a client, which is why the blog has been largely silent. They were in the Bay area, so I got to see first-hand some of the issues caused by the fires out there. It was bad -- visibility was obscured by the smoke and the air felt pretty toxic.

I actually saw one of the fires on my flight into LA (had meetings there as well). It's small, but there's a column of smoke in the middle upper right:

I hear things are clearing up -- hopefully everything will be back to normal for them soon.

As for me, now that I'm back, I'm going to be posting again regularly. I'm also going to be working on filling that contract for the next four to six weeks. And that's where the title of this blog becomes a horrible play on words, because...

...the contract is forty hours a week. Which means I'm back to full-time, _regularly scheduled programming_, for the first time since the end of April of this year.

I apologize for the pun. ðŸ˜­

Anyway, with having full-time development on my plate again, I'm not going to be able to post as frequently with any hope of maintaining some semblance of quality or thought in my posts. I'll be publishing new content three times a week now on a M-W-F schedule.

We'll see if that can be maintained. Between filling the contract, figuring out how to get more work in the short term, and keeping up with the posting here for the long-term gameplan, I've got my hands pretty full. And that's not to mention a social life, or sleep, or anything like that.

So yeah, that's about it for today -- I have a little more time in my day to work, but I'm going to save it for strategizing on how to bring more work in through the door and also the post for Wednesday.

See you on the flip side!

P.S. This is the first contract that I'll be filling through my company [Panther Contracting](https://panthercontracting.com) -- pretty exciting stuff! Nice to see some movement. The work came in through my Stack Overflow profile.
