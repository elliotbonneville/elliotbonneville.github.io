Welcome to Coding Panther, where Elliot Bonneville writes about his life.

He is currently an entrepreneurially minded JavaScript consultant who works through his company [Panther Contracting](https://www.panthercontracting.com).

He is comfortable writing about himself in the third person. He enjoys writing, reading, music, and of course -- coffee, coding, and cats.

This blog serves as a catch-all for his musings on code, mindset, lifestyle, the existence of a consultant, and anything else he feels like sharing with the general public.
