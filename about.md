Welcome to Coding Panther, where Elliot Bonneville writes about code, mindset, lifestyle, the existence of a JavaScript consultant, and anything else he feels like sharing with the general public.

He is currently available for work through his company [Panther Contracting](https://www.panthercontracting.com).

He is comfortable writing about himself in the third person. He enjoys writing, reading, music, and of course -- coffee, coding, and cats. üêà
